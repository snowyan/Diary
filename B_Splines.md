### What is B-Splines
* B-splines are defined by a polunomial degree and a sequence of knots(i.e. the number and position of knots).
* Spline is a piecewise-polynomial function constructed using low degree polynomials which are continuously connected with smoothness conditions at joining points and the abscissas of these points are called 'knots'. The order of the spline m resembles the degree p of the used polynomial segments plus one (m = p +1) or the number of polynomials coefficients.( For instance, the cubic splines are constructed by third-degree polynomial and therefore, their order is m = 4).
* The order of spline function determines the smoothness of picecewise-defined curve since the derivatives up to order m-2 of adjacent polynomial segments must fit together at joining points
*  A spline function is determined by the degree of the polynomial "pieces", the polynomial coefficients and a collection of non descending knot values known as a knot vector or a knot sequence
### What is B-splines useful
* B-splines are very useful and popular tools for curve estimations in numerous applications.
### Why we need to optimize B-splines
### How we can optimize B-splines
* Free knot splines
* non-equidistant knot placement for the curve approximation 
### What is global analytic function?
* There is a point $x_0 \in \R$ such that the Taylor series of f at x_0 exists and converges to f on all of \R.
* There is a point x_0 \in \R such that f has a power series at x_0 that converges to f on all of \R.
* For every point x_0 \in \R, the Taylor series of f at x_0 exists and converges to f on all of \R.
* For every point x_0 \in \R, f has a power series at x_0 that converges to f on all of \R.
### What is banded matrix?
* banded matrix is a sparse matrix whose non-zero entries are confined to a diagonal band, 
* comprising the main diagonal and zero or more diagonals on either side.
### Many-body problem
* a general name for a vast category of physical problems pertaining to the properties of microscopic here implies that quantum mechanics has to be used to provide an accurate deseription of the system.
*  Many-body Schrodinger equation-- are the many-body knietic energy and potential energy operates seperately
*  Many-body wavefunction -- Contains the quantum probalility amplitude for every possible configuration of electrons
### Knot sequence
* is a finite or bi-infinite nondecreasing sequence of real numbers without accumulation points
