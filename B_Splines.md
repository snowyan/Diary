### What is global analytic function?
* There is a point $x_0 \in \R$ such that the Taylor series of f at x_0 exists and converges to f on all of \R.
* There is a point x_0 \in \R such that f has a power series at x_0 that converges to f on all of \R.
* For every point x_0 \in \R, the Taylor series of f at x_0 exists and converges to f on all of \R.
* For every point x_0 \in \R, f has a power series at x_0 that converges to f on all of \R.
### Waht is banded matrix?
* banded matrix is a sparse matrix whose non-zero entries are confined to a diagonal band, 
* comprising the main diagonal and zero or more diagonals on either side.
