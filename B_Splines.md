### What is global analytic function?
* There is a point $x_0 \in \R$ such that the Taylor series of f at x_0 exists and converges to f on all of \R.
* There is a point x_0 \in \R such that f has a power series at x_0 that converges to f on all of \R.
* For every point x_0 \in \R, the Taylor series of f at x_0 exists and converges to f on all of \R.
* For every point x_0 \in \R, f has a power series at x_0 that converges to f on all of \R.
### What is banded matrix?
* banded matrix is a sparse matrix whose non-zero entries are confined to a diagonal band, 
* comprising the main diagonal and zero or more diagonals on either side.
### Many-body problem
* a general name for a vast category of physical problems pertaining to the properties of microscopic here implies that quantum mechanics has to be used to provide an accurate deseription of the system.
*  Many-body Schrodinger equation-- are the many-body knietic energy and potential energy operates seperately
*  Many-body wavefunction -- Contains the quantum probalility amplitude for every possible configuration of electrons
### Knot sequence
* is a finite or bi-infinite nondecreasing sequence of real numbers without accumulation points
