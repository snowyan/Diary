# Named Entity Recognition (NER)

    NER is a sub-task of infomation extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities in text into predefined categories such as the name of persons, organizations, locations, expressions of times, quantities, monetary values and so on. NER sustems have been created that use linguistic grammer-based techniques as well as statistical models such as machine learning.

## How does NER work

 * First it works like indentifying the entities

 * Then calssifies them to allocate in a paritcular catogory like person name, organization or location

## NER methods

 * Ontology-base NER

    * It is knowledge based recogintion process in which colleciton of data sets containing words , terms and their interrelations

* Deep learning NER

    * It is much more accurate than Ontology. Especially the word embedding that is capable of understanding the semantic and syntactic relationship between various words.
