# Optimization Methods
### what is optimization algorithm 
* Optimization algorithm is a procedure which is executed iteratively by comparing various solutions till an optimum or a satisfactory solution is found.
### the tpye of optimization algorithms
* Deterministic Algorithms -- They use specific rules for moving one solution to other. These algorithms are in use to suite some times and have been successfully applied for many engineering design problems.
* Stochastic Algorithms -- The stochastic algorithms are ni nature with probabilistic translation rules. These are gaining popularity due to certain properties which deterministic algorithms do not have.
### Optimal problem formulation:
* A naive optimal design is achieved by comparing a few alternative solutions created by using a priori problem knowledge.
* First step is investigating the method feasibility of each design solution
* Then Estimate of underlying objective of each solution is compared and best solution is adopted
